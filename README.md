Bitmap fonts for humans
-----------------------

This repository contains bitmapped fonts from disused operating systems and graphical user interfaces.

As operating systems and GUIs have moved on to scalable vector fonts, the bitmap fonts that dominated
the 1980s and 1990s languish away in non-obvious and often binary formats that are rapidly falling
into obscurity.

The main purpose of this repository is to liberate these fonts from their binary shackles,
preserving the ancient art of monochrome bitmap typography for human appreciation.

The fonts in this repository are stored in a human-friendly text-based format. As such, the easiest way
to view them is to open the text files directly. Alternatively, you can use
[`monobit`](https://github.com/robhagemans/monobit) to render them to images or convert them to
font formats supported by current operating systems. You can also
[see the fonts as images here](http://robhagemans.github.io/monobit/).
